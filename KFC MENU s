I chose the KFC menu for my HTML code project because it is a globally recognized brand with a diverse and appealing range of food items that make for an engaging and visually interesting web design. The menu includes categories like chicken buckets, burgers, sides, and drinks, which allowed me to practice organizing content using HTML elements such as lists, tables, and images. Additionally, the KFC menu provided a real-world context for my coding, helping me better understand how HTML is used to build practical websites that users interact with every day. This made the project both educational and enjoyable.
